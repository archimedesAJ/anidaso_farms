        <p>
          Anidaso farms is a newly established poultry farm located in Berekuso
          (adjacent Berekuso CHPS compound) in the Akwapim south municipality of
          Eastern Region. The farm adopts intensive method of poultry farming
          where the animals are confined in a brick structure and the best
          practices in terms of feeding, medications and operations are adopted.
          Anidaso farms seeks to provide high quality and healthy chicken and
          eggs to consumers in Ghana at affordable prices. This venture will
          help create jobs for the youth as people will be employed to work on
          the farm and market the farmâ€™s product. The venture will also support
          the aged, youth and some community projects in its quest of giving
          back to society. Currently the demand for poultry chicken and its
          related product is very high and the local production cannot meet such
          huge demand. Therefore, Anidaso Farms entering this sector will help
          in meeting the rising demand and create jobs for the youth, as the
          farm is expected to be producing at least 300 chicken and 480 crate of
          eggs a year in the next five years of operation. Anidaso farms
          generates it revenue be sales of both chicken (live or dressed) and
          eggs to customers in Berekuso, Kitaase, Ayim, Agyementi, Comet,
          Kwabenya and Pokuase.
